# Experience as a data analyst role (in process of update)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a summary of a real-world analytics task done on the job with clients, specifically football clubs such as **Serie A/B FC**.  

The focus is on **corner kick analysis** using SQL (Redash), Python (Jupyter Notebooks), and BI (Tableau).  

The goal is to provide actionable insights to account manager & staff based on match events data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Store and query football match data using SQL.
- Analyze **corner kick patterns**: timing, location, and outcomes.
- Identify tactical insights to improve set-piece performance.
- Present results in a **business-friendly report** and dashboard.

## 🔍 Step by step

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Load CSV files into SQL database and Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Use SQL & Python to:
   - Calculate average number of corners per match.
   - Identify peak minutes for corners.
   - Analyze distribution of corner deliveries by pitch zone.
3. **Visualization** – Create:
   - Heatmaps of delivery zones.
   - Time-based distribution charts.
4. **Business Insights** – Examples:
   - Venezia FC had **65%** of corners in the last 10 matches delivered into the near-post zone.
   - Corners from the right side resulted in more shots on goal than left-side deliveries.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (Redash)** – Querying and aggregating match event data.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data wrangling and visualization.
- **Excel** – Quick pivot table analysis for non-technical staff.
- **Tableau / Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for coaches.

---

## 📊 Example Insights
> In matches where Venezia FC had more than **8 corners**, win probability increased by **17%**.  
> Most dangerous deliveries came from the right-side near-post area.
